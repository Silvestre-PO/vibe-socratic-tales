## 📖 Overview

**Socratic Tales** is a multimodal educational engine where a child's drawing becomes the teacher.

Unlike standard AI chatbots, we orchestrate a **Multi-Model Architecture**. We use the reasoning depth of **Gemini 2.5 Pro** to construct pedagogical metaphors (Socratic Method) and the speed of **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to generate real-time audio and visuals.

It transforms a static photo of a doodle into an interactive, voice-acted story that teaches science through experience, not facts.

## 🧠 The "Gemini 2.5" Architecture

We utilize specific models for specific cognitive and sensory tasks. This specialized routing ensures the highest quality reasoning with the lowest latency for media generation.

| Task | Model Used | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🧠 Reasoning Engine** | **`gemini-2.5-pro`** | Handles the complex "Socratic Logic," Visual Voice Profiling, and context engineering to ensure the character never gives direct answers. |
| **🎨 Illustration** | **`gemini-2.5-flash-image`** | Generates consistent character art in real-time, mimicking the child's original drawing style (crayon, marker, etc.). |
| **🗣️ Narration** | **`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`** | Provides ultra-low latency Text-to-Speech with emotional acting cues (e.g., *[Whimsical Voice]*). |

## ✨ Key Features

-   **📸 True Multimodal Input:** Analyzes the *style* of a physical drawing to generate a matching personality.
-   **🎓 Socratic Guardrails:** A rigorous system prompt prevents the model from being a "search engine," forcing it to be a "metaphor engine."
-   **⚡ Hybrid Latency:** Uses "Pro" models for thinking and "Flash" models for asset generation, optimizing the user wait time.
-   **🔊 Theatrical Audio:** The TTS engine acts out sound effects (e.g., *Whoosh!*) based on the script generated by the reasoning model.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Input:** User takes a photo of a drawing + asks a voice question.
2.  **Orchestration (The Brain):** `gemini-2.5-pro` analyzes the image style and the question. It generates a structured **JSON** storyboard.
3.  **Parallel Generation:**
    -   `gemini-2.5-flash-image` receives the visual prompt to render the next scene.
    -   `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts` receives the script to generate the audio narration.
4.  **Output:** The React frontend assembles these assets into an instant story.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **AI Orchestration:** Google GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`).
-   **Frontend:** React + Vite + TypeScript.
-   **Styling:** CSS Modules.
-   **State Management:** React Hooks.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Silvestre-PO/vibe-socratic-tales.git
    cd vibe-socratic-tales
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

1.  Get your API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
3.  Add your API key:

    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

    > **Note:** Ensure your API key has access to the `gemini-2.5-*` model family.

## ▶️ Usage

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
